# toolkit_anon
This repo of Toolkit files is provided for anonymous review. Each folder labeled "participantEngagement" is named for a participatory design session. Contents of these folders are iterations of toolkit elements developed subsequent to these sessions. The folder labeled "CURRENT_VERSION" contains toolkit elements as they were at the time papers were submitted for consideration.

Some versions of the toolkit (including more recent versions) are not included here to maintain anonymity and will be made available to readers after paper/conference acceptance.
